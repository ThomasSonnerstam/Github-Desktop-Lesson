# 02 - GitHub Desktop

GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHubâ€™s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

## Exercises

1. Start of by downloading [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Once you have opened the program, make sure to login to your GitHub account.

2. [Create a new public repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/create-a-repo) and name it "Hello World". Initialize the repository with a [README file](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/).

3. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) using GitHub Desktop and open the project with your editor of choice.

4. In your README file, add an `<h1>` header using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with the text "Hello World".

5. Save the file and go back to GitHub Desktop. Add a commit message/summary and [commit the changes](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop#part-5-making-committing-and-pushing-changes).

6. On the top right in GitHub Desktop, push your changes to GitHub.

7. Go back to your repository on GitHub in your browser and refresh the page. You should now see your changes. Cool, right?

8. Your README file probably looks a little bland now. Let's change that! [Add a GIF](https://giphy.com/) to your README file using Markdown. This time, add it using the GitHub-editor by clicking the pen icon. Once you're done, add a commit message once again and commit the changes.

9. Go back to GitHub Desktop. Now on the top right you should see "Pull origin". Click it, and you should see the changes you made on GitHub appear in your local directory.

10. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) a classmate's repository to your GitHub account.

11. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) the forked repository to your computer.

12. Make some changes by adding some new text or another image. Commit and push the changes. Now it's time to make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) to your classmate's repository.

13. Help your classmate [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request) the pull request.

14. **Extra:** In your repository, create a new file and name it `ignore-this-file.txt`.

15. **Extra:** Now create another file called `.gitignore`. Write `ignore-this-file.txt` in the .gitignore. Save the file, add, commit, and push the changes.

16. **Extra:** Finally, go back to GitHub, and if you're successful the ignore-this-file.txt file should not be there.
